# Jupyter Notebook Pre-Commit Git Hook Sample

Data science projects often start with using jupyter notebooks for exploration.
When sharing results with others, it helps to have the python code separate
from generated plots and plots separated from the code when sharing
visualizations to others. Using a `pre-commit` githook to capture plots and
code separately allows data science projects to be more organized and more
easily be transitioned from exploration to production.

[Git Hooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks) are scripts you can put in a
hooks directory. In this case, we decided to use `.githooks` as our hooks
directory. The hooks will trigger actions at certain points in gitâ€™s execution.

For example, the [pre-commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_pre_commit),
is invoked before obtaining the proposed commit log message and making a commit.

## Setup Requirements

* Git version `>=2.9` installed on your system.
* Filenames **must not contain spaces**.
* `jq`

## Setup

Create an `.env` file and specify `NOTEBOOKS_PATH`, `SCRIPTS_PATH`, and
`HTML_PATH`.

For example:

```sh
export NOTEBOOKS_PATH="notebooks"
export SCRIPTS_PATH="scripts"
export HTML_PATH="html"
```

Run:

```sh
source .env
make
```

This will set up the git hooks directory to point to a directory
called `.githooks`. Now, whenever you commit, the `pre-commit` hook will run.

Add and commit your changed notebook files to git.

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Added iris exploration notebook."
```

## FAQ

If you encounter an error when saving `.ipynb` file as a script, such as
`mv: cannot stat 'notebooks/iris_exploration.py': No such file or directory`,
you should restart the jupyter server and try again.
